**_Discover Your Next Anime Adventure: Where Spoilers Dare Not Tread!_**

## <u> I. Introduction </u> ##

### A. Purpose ###

Anime communities have thrived on website forums, vibrant hubs where fans passionately engage with their favorite content. Yet, navigating the tricky terrain of spoilers has remained a consistent challenge over the years.

Our primary goal is to create a welcoming and secure environment that fosters vibrant discussions among anime fans and their friends, with a particular focus on minimizing spoilers. By integrating spoiler tags in comments and discussions, we ensure that our community remains inclusive and healthy. This feature allows avid viewers to freely discuss the latest episodes, while protecting the viewing experience for those who may be catching up.


### B. Industry/ domain ###

The primary domain of this project is the **entertainment** industry, specifically **focusing on anime streaming and fan engagement.** This sector is currently thriving but faces challenges in spoiler management. 

The anime industry's value chain encompasses content creation, licensing, distribution, merchandising, and fan engagement, with key concepts including simulcasting, fan subbing, anime seasons, and spoiler management techniques.

Additionally, the project's relevance extends beyond anime, offering valuable insights and applications to other industries such as film, television, gaming, and literature, where managing spoilers and enhancing community engagement are equally critical.

 ### B. User Stories ###

 As an anime' viewer, I've had my fair share of frustrations with spoilers and non-customisable list of the shows that I want to watch. I've honed in on the _three pain points_ I consistently encounter when visiting anime websites.

To ensure top-notch quality, scalability, and seamless maintenance, I'm taking a targeted approach by addressing each pain point with one distinct feature and its corresponding design. 


<code style = "color : yellow"> <b>1</b> Pain Point : <b>1</b> Feature : <b>1</b> Design</code>
  

*** Three Pain Points - Feature ***

1. Spoilers -> Spoiler tag in the comment section
2. Limited sharing with Friends -> Privacy / Friend request (Keep spoil-mongers away!)
3. Customised Anime List -> Minimalist design (Animelist websites have superlative lists in general.)


### C. User Flow / Wire frame Design ###
